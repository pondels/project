'''
Detailed and organized coverage of the topic with 
documentation including (but not limited to) example 
Python code, diagrams, and tables. You should assume
that the student using your tutorial will already 
know how to program in Python. This should be 
written in your own words. Remember, you are the
teacher now.

A complete example of a problem solved using the 
data structure. The problem should be created by 
you and not be a copy of an existing problem.

A second problem (again created by you) which is 
given to the student of your tutorial to solve on 
their own. You need to provide a link to the solution.

Your tutorial must use the Python programming language.

# CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING
What is the purpose of the data structure?

What is the performance of the data structure (you will need to talk about big O notation)?

What kind of problems can be solved using the data structure?

How would the data structure be used in Python (in some cases you will need to discuss recursion)?

What kind of errors are common when using the data structure?

Welcome to my tutorial on data structures within python. Learning data manipulation and structuring is very crucial for every programmer to understand and use to their advantage.

Topics that will be covered in sequential order are:
1) [Big O Notation](0.5-bigo.md)
2) [Queues](1-queues.md)
3) [Sets](2-sets.md)
4) [Binary Trees](3-trees.md)
